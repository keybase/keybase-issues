### First, security bugs

If you are aware of a security bug (or have a proposal/implemention of a "zero day" attack), notifying us privately is in the interest of all users. We can then discuss it post-mortem. To reach us privately, please get our public keys here:

  - https://keybase.io/max
  - https://keybase.io/chris
  
You can import our keys to GPG - and verify our Keybase.io admin status - with `keybase track max` and `keybase track chris`.

### Other bugs, issues, comments, questions, and suggestions

There's an [issues tab](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues) in the right margin of this page. The direct link:

  - https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues

We appreciate comments, questions, [feature requests](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518), etc.

Keybase has a few repos (see below), and we can't expect you to know where to post issues. So post everything here. We'll tag and organize it all.

### If you'd like to review our code

We'd like that too.

  * https://github.com/keybase/node-client - the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/node-installer - the installer for the command line client
  * https://github.com/keybase/gpg-wrapper - library for communicating with GPG's CLI
  * https://github.com/keybase/pgp-utils - crypto utilities for dealing with MACs, Signatures, and PGP message formats.
