## Client-side (app) bugs:

If you've installed Keybase on your desktop, run:

```bash
# this will submit logs and provide a ticket link for you
keybase log send
```

and follow the instructions. If you're on a mobile device, please just post to [client issue tracker](https://github.com/keybase/client/issues).

## Serious security bugs

If you are aware of a security bug (or have a proposal/implemention of a "zero day" attack), notifying us privately is in the interest of all users. We can then discuss it post-mortem. To reach us privately, please get our public keys here:

  - https://keybase.io/max
  - https://keybase.io/chris
  
You can import our keys to GPG with `keybase pgp pull max` and `keybase pgp pull chris`.

## Everything else, including website bugs, ideas and suggestions

There's an [issues tab](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues) on this page.
